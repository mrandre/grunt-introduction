An Introduction to Git
======================

This is a repository which goes with a presentation on learning Grunt. You can view an outline of the talk by opening outline/index.html in your browser of choice.

Basically, we're going to start with an empty directory, and build a simple Gruntfile that can concatenate and minify some files. The intent here is to understand concepts, not to be exhaustive.

Each step along the way has a git tag:

  * 1-intialized-app
  * 2-install-grunt
  * 3-base-gruntfile
  * 4-basic-config
  * 5-concat-plugin
  * 6-uglify-plugin
  * 7-register-task
  * 8-coffee-version

The outline notes where each tag applies.

The default state of the repo is a finished product that works correctly.
