grunt-introduction
==================

This is a repo which goes with a presentation on learning Grunt. The presentation is TBD.

Basically, we're going to start with an empty directory, and build a simple Gruntfile that can concatenate and minify some files. The intent here is to understand concepts, not to be exhaustive.

Each step along the way has a git tag:

  * 1-intialized-app
  * 2-install-grunt
  * 3-base-gruntfile
  * 4-basic-config
  * 5-concat-plugin
  * 6-uglify-plugin
  * 7-register-task
  * 8-coffee-version
